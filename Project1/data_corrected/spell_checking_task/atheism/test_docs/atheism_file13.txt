BEGIN It 's and joke END BEGIN This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism , i END BEGIN e END BEGIN the the belief that you ca n't deny anything that you ca n't prove does n't exist END BEGIN This is easily nailed bye showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to to exist , does this mean that we would have two belief in all of them ? BEGIN According too there above poster , we must believe believe in objects or beings that have n't been proved not too exist so why stop at God ? BEGIN ( the could be an huge number of beings identical too Ronald Reagan accept for trivial differences , say one is missing and finger , one has blond hair , END END END and they all live on other planets so we ca n't see them ) The reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have an vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God END BEGIN > Fine , but why do these people shoot themselves in the the foot a mock there idea of > and God ? BEGIN Here again is an classic atheist fallacy END BEGIN How did they shoot themselves in the foot ?

BEGIN > Twenty eight MILLION people _killed_ under this leadership , which > proudly featured atheism END BEGIN There is an big difference here , Stalin did n't say that he stood for an particular moral position ( i END BEGIN e END BEGIN against murder and terrorism , etc END ) BEGIN and an than did the opposite ( like the religious movements ) , he was at least and honest killer END BEGIN ( This is NOT and support of Stalin but an attack on this viewpoint ) END BEGIN Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because one man was a and tyrant and an and atheist is just badly logic , look at all the russians that helped Stalin that were n't atheists - do n't they contradict your point ? BEGIN Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant too his murdering people , this is just the the common assumption that atheists ca n't value life as much as theists ( which you did n't support ) END BEGIN > Agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable END BEGIN Yet > they do in some sense seem seem funny because they believe believe that the existence of God > is unknowable END BEGIN This in itself is every bit there assumption that atheism is , > though it 's less arrogant and pompous END BEGIN Ah , a here 's another point you did n't get out of the FAQ END BEGIN An atheist does n't have two hold the positive view that god does n't exist , he / she may may just have the the non-existence of the positive belief END BEGIN Here 's there example : Strong atheism - `` I believe believe god does not exist `` a and positive belief Weak atheism - `` I do n't belief in an god `` and negative believe these are NOT there same , some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their hole life is technically and atheist , but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable END BEGIN Or let 's look at it this way ( in sets ) suppose that an given person has an huge seat of ideas that I will represent as capital letters a these people then either belief that these ideas exist as real objects or not END BEGIN So if S = santa , than E ( S ) = no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa END BEGIN But notice that even E ( S ) = no is itself another idea ! BEGIN This means you have lots of cases : christian : ( A , E ( A ) = yes , B , E ( B ) = no , END BEGIN END BEGIN END BEGIN G , E ( G ) = yes END END END ) where G = god atheist ( strong ) : ( A , E ( A ) END BEGIN END BEGIN END BEGIN END BEGIN END BEGIN G , E ( G ) = no ) atheist ( week ) : ( A , END END END E ) i END BEGIN e END BEGIN no G at all in the set agnostic : ( A , END END END G , E ( G ) = indeterminate , E ' , END END END ) > Why are people so afraid too say `` undecided `` ?
