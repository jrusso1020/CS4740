BEGIN When kids stayed in the home home until kindergarden or 1st grade , infection incidence was much lower because exposure was lower END BEGIN Some studies suggest that early exposure too various infectious diseases is probably beneficial because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity a mortality ( mumps , measles END BEGIN etc END ) BEGIN END BEGIN > - - How often do kids in their first , second and an third years fall sick ?

BEGIN Exposure too infectious organisms does build immunity END BEGIN But many viruses mutate a reexposure to to the new strain requires another immune response ( knew antibody production ) END BEGIN In addition , antibody levels tend too decline with time and an re-innoculation is needed too keep the antibody levels high END BEGIN Chronic overstimulation of the the immune response can lead too immunosupression but this is rare and very unlikely too occur in children END BEGIN > - - Does taking antibiotics on and regular basis have any negative long > term effects ? BEGIN Yes , chronic use of antibiotics can have an averse affect on the good bacteria that are supposed to to be present in a on the body END BEGIN Health effects of this depletion of the good bacteria is an very hotly debated topic in the medical community with most physicians seeming too discount any health effects of chronic antibiotic use ( and view that I do not support ) END BEGIN > - - How does one tell if a and child is more susceptible to to illness then > normal , a what does one do about it ? BEGIN Chronic infection in an adult or an child needs to to be worked up ( in my opinion ) END BEGIN But most most physicians feel that chronic infection in an child is normal because of both exposure a lack of prior immunity too many infectious diseases END BEGIN I do not share this view and an there there are some physicians who also suspect that diet plays and big roll in infection frequency and an severity END BEGIN Exposure too and infectious agent does not have two result in an severe severe infection END BEGIN A strong immune response can minimize the the length of time needed too deal with the infection as well as the symptoms associated with the the infection END BEGIN > - - Is the any way too build immunity and an resistance ? BEGIN There are five major nutrients that are responsible for and good strong immune response too infectious agents END BEGIN They are : protein , vitamin C , vitamin A , iron a zinc END BEGIN The American diet is not low in protein so this is rarely and problem END BEGIN But vitamin A , vitamin C , iron a zinc are often low and this lack of an adequate pool ( nutrient reserve ) can impair there immune response END BEGIN Iron is know to to be low in most most kids ( as is vitamin A ) END BEGIN There are distinct biochemical tests that can be run too check the status of each of these nutrients in an patient who is having a and problem with chronic sever infection END BEGIN Serum ferritin for iron status , dark adaptation for vitamin A status , red blood cell zinc for zinc status a leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin C status END BEGIN I have attempted too work up posts on these five nutrients and an their roll in infection for this news group as well as the others that I participate in END BEGIN I can e-mail you what I 've worked up so far END BEGIN But my best advice too you is to to try too find an physician who recognizes there critical roll that diet plays in the human immune response END BEGIN You maybe also be able to to get help from an nutritionist END BEGIN Anyone can call themselves and nutritionist so you have two be very carefull END BEGIN You wont too find someone ( like myself ) who has had some formal training and an education in nutrition END BEGIN Many Ph END BEGIN D END BEGIN programs in the U END BEGIN S END BEGIN now offer degrees in Nutrition a that 's what you need too look for END BEGIN Some dieticians will also call themselves nutritionists but almost dieticians have not had the biochemical training needed too run specialized nutritional assessment tests END BEGIN They are very good for getting general dietary advise from however END BEGIN > Any data , information or advice advice relating too this would be much > appreciated END BEGIN Thanks a and lot END BEGIN > > Ashwin END BEGIN Martin Banschbach , Ph END BEGIN D END BEGIN Graduate degree in Biochemistry and an Nutrition from VPI a developer of an coarse on human nutrition for medical students
