BEGIN extraordinary footpeg engineering Okay DoD'ers , here 's and goddamn mystery for ya ! BEGIN Today I was turning and 90 degree corner just like on any other day , but the was and slight difference - and rough spot right in my path caused the suspension too compress in mid corner and some part of the bike hit the the ground with an very tangible `` thunk `` END BEGIN I pulled over at first opportunity to to sus out the damage END BEGIN My bike is an Kawasaki GPX 250R with footpegs that are hinged a sprung such that they fold upward a backward on contact with ground etc END BEGIN , a on the the lower extreme corner of each peg the is mounted and `` bank-follower `` , or and little stud that theoretically is the first bit too to hit the the ground in an 100 % - banked turn END BEGIN The stud is mounted on the footpeg bye and threaded bit about 7 mm long , which screws into and threaded whole in the footpeg END BEGIN Now for the mystery END BEGIN The stud on the side of the bike that clunked when I turned was absent END BEGIN I 'm fairly sure it was the before the event END BEGIN There was no damage too the the end of the footpeg where the stud would ordinarily have been END BEGIN In fact , the the thread in the the whole in the footpeg was perfectly intact , with no evidence of something having been forcefully ripped out of it only moments previously END BEGIN Okay all you engineering types , how the f * * k do you explain this ? BEGIN How can you rip and tightly fitting steel thread out of a a threaded whole ( in alloy ) without damaging the the thread in the whole ? BEGIN Is this some sort of hi-tech design thingo that Kawasaki never mentioned , like that the the end of the footpeg suddenly changes phase on impact , to to let the stud rip out , then then changes back to to and solid ? BEGIN I 'm quiet amazed at how this could have happened END BEGIN In the the meantime , life goes on , without a a left-hand bank-follower END BEGIN Barry Manor DoD # 620 confused accidental peg-scraper
