BEGIN Re : Food For Thought On Tyre There has been and lot of discussion about Tyre END BEGIN In sum , Ezekiel prophesied that the place would be mashed and an never rebuilt ; as the are and lot of people living the , it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct END BEGIN This does n't bother me at all , because I understand the language Ezekiel used differently then do so-called Biblical literalists END BEGIN For example , it sometimes sometimes happens that someone says `` My grandson is the cutest baby ! `` BEGIN and then turns around a sees the the granddaughter a says `` Oh ! BEGIN Is n't she there cutest thing ! BEGIN ? `` BEGIN This person is not literally claiming too have lined up all the babies in the world according too cuteness a discovered his own grandchildren tied for first END BEGIN Rather , he is trying too express his emotions using words that are very object-oriented END BEGIN Because this example is one that is common to to many people , nobody misunderstands there intent of the statements ; there Bible , however , is often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly literally true END BEGIN For dozens people , the the existence of Tyre is an problem ; for me , it is not END BEGIN Turning too there latest person trying too defend Ezekiel , we read this from John E King : > The prophesy clearly implies that people would still be living in the the > area [ END ] BEGIN No , it implies nothing of the kind END BEGIN If you had nothing but the prophecy from Ezekiel , a you were told you interpret it literally , you would never say `` Oh , he means that the will be houses a businesses and an plants a stuff like that END `` BEGIN You would read `` I will make you and bear rock `` and an `` You will never be rebuilt `` , a you 'd conclude that Tyre would be an bear rock END BEGIN The only way too get from ` fishing nets ' too ` houses a buildings a and a medium-large population ' is if you KNOW that all that later stuff is the the END BEGIN In other words , your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the prophecy at the the time it was written END BEGIN There is no way that , given and literal reading , they could read this passage a conclude `` medium-size city `` END BEGIN You seam too feel that `` Never be rebuilt `` means `` be rebuilt `` - - may so , but it is hardly and ` clear implication ' END BEGIN Mr King also writes : > So far I 've seen stated figurers ranging from 15,000 too 22,000 END BEGIN > Let 's assume the latter one is correct END BEGIN By modern standards > we are talking about an one-horse town END BEGIN Well , no END BEGIN That 's only an bit less than the population of Annapolis , where I 'm from END BEGIN You know , the the Naval Acadamy , there state capital , George Washington resigned his commission in the statehouse ? BEGIN Annapolis maybe not be New York , but it 's at least and two-horse town END BEGIN But supposing 22,000 people is an `` small town `` - - it 's still 22,000 people MORE than than Ezekiel predicted END BEGIN And you 've said nothing about the other problem END BEGIN In chapter 26 , Ezekiel predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre a loot all their valuables END BEGIN However , Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre , a in chapter 29 Ezekiel even quotes God as saying `` he and an his army got no reward from the the campaign he lead against Tyre END `` BEGIN Let 's ignore Alexander for an moment , and an just pay attention too chapter 26 END BEGIN Ezekiel says N END BEGIN would destroy Tyre , a N END BEGIN did NOT destroy Tyre END BEGIN Ezekiel says that N END BEGIN would plunder their valuables , but N END BEGIN did NOT plunder their valuables END BEGIN Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_ , there fact is that N END BEGIN died before the place was destroyed END BEGIN Ezekiel said N END BEGIN was going too do it , and an N END BEGIN did not END BEGIN * This post is , of course , pointless END BEGIN Inerrantists have an amazing ability too rewrite the the Bible as needed too fit whatever they want it too say END BEGIN For example , I expect Mr King too respond too there comments about Ezekiel 26 bye pulling some `` clear implications `` out of hat END BEGIN When Ezekiel said that N END BEGIN would `` demolish your towers `` , that clearly implied that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the the towers used too be END BEGIN And when Ezekiel said that N END BEGIN would `` demolish your fine houses a throw your stones , timber a rubble into the sea `` , that clearly implied that N END BEGIN would never seat foot on the island END BEGIN And when Ezekiel wrote that N END BEGIN would `` build and ramp up too your walls `` , that clearly implies that N END BEGIN would spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland a never get close too there walls END BEGIN See ?
