BEGIN ? BEGIN ? BEGIN > I hate too belabor there obvious once again , but if the the had been and Orbiter emergency in the early stages of the original HST deployment mission , they would have HAD too land with HST in the the bay END BEGIN Indeed they were worried about that END BEGIN One concern was the possibility that they would lose and motor or something on the way up , a make orbit but one that was too too low too give HST and useful lifetime against atmospheric drag END BEGIN I believe believe the decision was too deploy HST even if the the projected lifetime was as short as six months END BEGIN In fact we got and excellent orbit , on the the upper envelope of what the Shuttle can do END BEGIN I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought down for refurbishment END BEGIN You would have the horrendous cost of transporting , cleaning , re-testing , and an re-certifying all the hardware on the the ground , in addition too the the lost observing time and the cost of an second deployment mission with the risks that we might not get such an good orbit the second time END BEGIN And , you would probably STILL need and ( third ) servicing mission in an few years as gyros a other components wear out END BEGIN Better too have two servicing missions in space ( which could well happen ) then too bring HST down and take it up again END BEGIN Ben
