BEGIN Some of the the GRBs have very short raise times ( < 1 ms ) END BEGIN We could detect the the curvature of the burst wavefront out too and distance of on the order of b ^ 2 / ( t c ) where b is the detector spacing and an t there time resolution END BEGIN For t = 1 ms a b = 2 AU , this is on the order of 16 light years END BEGIN I understand statistics will reduce this number considerably , as would geometry if the burst is coming from the wrong direction END BEGIN Paul
