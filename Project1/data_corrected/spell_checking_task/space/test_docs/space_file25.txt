BEGIN Re : Space Station Redesign , JSC Alternative # 4 In article < 1993Apr23 END 184732 END 1105 @ aio END jsc END nasa END gov > , kjenks @ gothamcity END jsc END nasa END gov writes END END END { Description of `` External Tank `` option for SSF redesign deleted } > Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea 's committee in Crystal City , > a he reports that he was warmly received END BEGIN However , there rumors > I hear hear say that an design based on an wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter > seems more likely END BEGIN Yo Ken , let 's keep on-top of things ! BEGIN Both the the `` External Tank `` a `` Wingless Orbiter `` options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list END BEGIN Today 's ( 4/23 ) edition of the New York Times reports that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped , such as using the `` giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles , `` a building a and `` station around and existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed END `` BEGIN Currently , the are three options being considered , as presented too the the advisory panel meeting yesterday ( a as reported in today 's Times ) END BEGIN Option `` A `` - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied bye and team from MSFC END BEGIN { As and aside , the are SSF redesign teams at MSFC , JSC , a LaRC supporting the the SRT ( Station Redesign Team ) in Crystal City END BEGIN Both LeRC and an Reston folks are also on-site at these locations , helping there respective teams with their redesign activities END } BEGIN Key features of this option are : - Uses `` Bus - 1 `` , a and modular bus developed by by Lockheed that 's qualified for STS a ELV 's END BEGIN The bus provides propulsion , GN & C Communications , & Data Management END BEGIN Lockheed developed this for the Air Force END BEGIN - A `` Power Station Capability `` is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights END BEGIN SSF Solar arrays are used too provide 20 kW of power END BEGIN The vehicle flies in an `` arrow mode `` to to optimize there microgravity environment END BEGIN Shuttle / Spacelab missions would utilize the the vehilce as an power source for 30 day missions END BEGIN - Human tended capability ( as opposed too there old SSF sexist term of man-tended capability ) is achieved bye there addition of the US Common module END BEGIN This is an modified version of the existing SSF Lab module ( docking ports are added for the International Partners ' labs , taking the place of the the nodes on SSF ) END BEGIN The Shuttle can be docked to to the station for 60 day missions END BEGIN The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability END BEGIN - International Human Tended END BEGIN Add there NASDA & ESA modules , a add another 20 kW of power - Permanent Human Presence Capability END BEGIN Add and 3rd power module , the the U END BEGIN S END BEGIN habitation module , a and an ACRV ( Assured Crew Return Vehicle ) END BEGIN Option `` B `` - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option `` B `` team is based at LaRC , a is lead lead bye Mike Griffin END BEGIN This option looks alot like the existing SSF design , which we have all come too know a love : ) This option assumes an lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights ( so does option `` A `` ) END BEGIN Also , there number of flights is computed for an 51 END 6 inclination orbit , for both options `` A `` a `` B `` END BEGIN The build-up occurs in six phases : - Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights END BEGIN Power is transferred from the vehicle too there Orbiter / Spacelab , when it visits END BEGIN - Man-Tended Capability ( Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist language ) is achieved after 8 flights END BEGIN The U END BEGIN S END BEGIN Lab is deployed , a 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power END BEGIN - Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights , bye keeping one Orbiter on-orbit too use as an ACRV ( so sometimes sometimes the would be too Orbiters on-orbit - there ACRV , a there second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply ) END BEGIN - A `` Two Fault Tolerance Capability `` is achieved after 14 flights , with the addition of an 2nd power module , another thermal control system radiator , a more propulsion modules END BEGIN - After 20 flights , there Internationals are on-board END BEGIN More power , the the Habitation module , a and an ACRV are added too finish there assembly in 24 flights END BEGIN Most of the the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option , with the the exception of the the data management system , which has major changes END BEGIN Option C - Single Core Launch Station END BEGIN This is the JSC led option END BEGIN Basically , you take an 23 ft diameter cylinder that 's 92 ft long , slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on the the backside , put an nose cone on the top , attached it too and regular shuttle external tank and an and regular set of solid rocket motors , a launch the can END BEGIN Some key features are : - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels - body mounted radiators ( which adds protection against micrometeroid & orbital debris ) - 2 centerline docking ports ( one on each end ) - 7 berthing ports - and single pressurized volume , approximately 26,000 cubic feet ( twice there volume of skylab ) END BEGIN - 7 floors , center passageway between floors - 10 kW of housekeeping power - graceful degradation with failures ( 8 power channels , 4 thermal loops , dual environmental control & life support system ) - increased crew time for utilization - 1 micro-g thru out there core module
