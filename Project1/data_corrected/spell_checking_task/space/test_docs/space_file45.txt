BEGIN RIMSAT , US / Russian joint venture I 've been too three talks in the last month which might be of interest END BEGIN I 've transcribed some of my notes below END BEGIN Since my note taking ability is bye no means infallible , pleased assume that all factual errors are mine END BEGIN Permission is granted to to copy this without restriction END BEGIN Michael Sternberg , Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT , was invited too speak at an informal lunch held bye ACDIS hear on the campus of the University of Illinois END BEGIN ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control , Disarmament a International Security END BEGIN RIMSAT was considered and appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers a satellites END BEGIN I think it also helped that his daughter is a and grad student in the the International Relations program END BEGIN The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson ( ? ) BEGIN went went too Tonga too visit and a friend END BEGIN While he was the , he somehow ended up visiting the the king , who happened too be an big TV fan END BEGIN Matt bought there King and satellite dish , which the king thought was really nifty END BEGIN Since Tonga has a and GNP of about $ 70 million , His Majesty asked if the was any way too make money off this END BEGIN Matt thought the probably was , so at his suggestion , Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots END BEGIN While this is n't entirely off the wall , it was very unusual , seeing as Tonga was a and tiny kingdom with no space program , a 31 is an lot of slots END BEGIN The whole whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard ( who is apparently and respected space lawyer ) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga 's case END BEGIN Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots , ranging from 70 E too 170 E ( slots are designated bye the the longitude over which they reside ) END BEGIN According too Sternberg , four of these , from 130 E too 142 E are the the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii a the the Pacific Rim END BEGIN RIMSAT was formed too use these slots END BEGIN It was officially formed in Nevis as an tax haven END BEGIN They tried for an few years too rise funds in the west , however , too fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $ 2 billion END BEGIN It 's not easy to to raise that kind of money END BEGIN Eventually , they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware END BEGIN They began negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware END BEGIN Mr Sternberg describes operating in Moscow in such harsh terms that I do n't think I 'll visit the for a and long time END BEGIN Besides and significant lack of creature comforts , he was not happy with the the way that people operate END BEGIN For example `` everybody can sell you everything END `` BEGIN Everyone can show there proper documents a licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority too sell what ever you want too by by END BEGIN Eventually , RIMSAT arranged and deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at an cost of $ 150 million END BEGIN However , Glavkosmos lost favor after the the coup END BEGIN Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a and bunch of KGB operatives who want to to trade shows a picked up lots of brochures END BEGIN Since Glavkosmos was out of power , he had too renegotiate there deal with the the new authorities END BEGIN He again described life in an Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms END BEGIN Eventually , he worked out and deal a on Dec 4 , 1992 he met with Koptev , who heads there Russian space program , too sign there deal END BEGIN Koptev insisted on an few concessions before signing a according too Sternberg he arranged these new new rules too allow himself too form another company too do the exact same thing as RIMSAT END BEGIN The next step was too meat with the builders of the hardware , NPO Applied Mechanics - - NPO PM too use their acronym END BEGIN This organization is located in Siberia ( ca n't figure out how too spell there town , I need and atlas ) a has built about 1500 vehicles vehicles since the dawn of the space age END BEGIN Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites END BEGIN They are hard workers , honest people who team up too get things done , very much like midwesterners END BEGIN At this point the were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians a midwesterners : - ) Sternberg had lots of good things too say about NPO PM END BEGIN His company is apparently lookng for $ 100 million too invest in the firm too become 50 % partners END It apparently costs there Russians about $ 4 million to to build a and satellite that would sell for $ 50 million in the west END BEGIN If you want too give them specifications , they 'll build you and satellite END BEGIN For there particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using , costs run about $ 378,000 per transponder year END BEGIN This compares too $ 810,000 t / y in the the U END BEGIN S END BEGIN They can sell their time for about $ 1 END 1 million compared too $ 2 END 6 million in the U END BEGIN S END BEGIN RIMSAT will launch their satellites on Protons END BEGIN To get the best prices , they bought in bulk END BEGIN They have the the rights to to twelve launches , so if any of you need and lift I can give you their address END BEGIN The first launch is scheduled for October and an they are getting one used satellite from the Russians , which is being moved into place now END BEGIN Tidbits : * Sternberg says this kind of thing has too be done bye entrepreneurs , not big business because big business is just like what they have over the , accept that `` we have better paper , both in the bathroom a in the the copier END `` BEGIN * Russian launches are self insured END BEGIN The promise too replace a and failed launch within 9 months END BEGIN * Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20 , which is an huge retirement fund organization , Cellsat , which is an big telecom business in southeast Asia , a and fund operated by by some of the the big names in U END BEGIN S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off END BEGIN * He downplayed there instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we are n't used to to seeing Russia as anything but and unvarying monolith END BEGIN Italy gets a and new new government `` every too weeks `` but we do n't worry because we 're used too it END BEGIN He predicted that once we get used too seeing what really goes on in Russia we wo n't worry about their stability as much END BEGIN * Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the the problem of transfering money END BEGIN The central bank has an policy of taking hard currency payments , putting 25 % in their coffers a replacing there rest with the `` equivalent `` value in rubles END BEGIN To get around this , RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account END BEGIN NPO PM then then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled bye there government END BEGIN * One of the the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling bye there western satellite industry END BEGIN However , Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites , which was rather reassuring END BEGIN * The biggest worry almost people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime END BEGIN The older Gorizont ( Horizon ) satellites have an lifetime of about 5 years , while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years END BEGIN While this is much shorter then 15 years for western satellites , Sternberg downplayed there difference END BEGIN At these prices they can afford to to launch knew ones END BEGIN In addition , shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able too compete better than older , out of date hardware END BEGIN -
