BEGIN We know from Genesis that Eve was offered and opportunity too sin bye a and tempter which many assume was Satan , but how did Lucifer discover , invent , create , call the action what you will , something that God had not given origin too ? BEGIN Also , where in the the Bible is the mention of Lucifer 's free will ? BEGIN We make an big fuss about mankind having free will , but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation , a in fact , like salvation , not one that all Christians belief in identically END BEGIN At least in my mind , salvation a free will are very tightly coupled , but then my theology was Roman Catholic END END END BEGIN Still , how do theologian explain Lucifer 's fall ?
