BEGIN Guzzi 850 - T tires , plus fairing question I have an question about tires for my Guzzi END BEGIN It is an ' 75 850 - T END BEGIN The tires that were on it when I just bought it are old a cracked END BEGIN I do not have an owners manual for it ( yet ) , but the the tires listed in the Haynes manual are : Front , 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4 END 10 H 18 , and an pressures recommended are 26 front and 33 rear END BEGIN Oddly , there pressure for the the same tire on the T - 3 is listed at 29 psi instead END BEGIN Anyone know the reason ? BEGIN As I know though , there pressure I should run at is that recommended bye there manufacturer of the the new tires I purchase END BEGIN The real question I have is this END BEGIN The old tires that are on the bike are for the the front , a a Metzler Touring Special , 4 END 10 H 18 , and an for the rear and Avon Roadrunner 4 END 70 H 18 , ( 120/90 ) H 18 as marked on each tire END BEGIN Both are larger then that listed in the Haynes Manual END BEGIN What does there owners manual recommend , and an was it common too go up one size for this bike ? BEGIN Also , this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes END BEGIN Any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities ? BEGIN The above sizes are inches ( accept for the additional mark on the the current rear tire ) END BEGIN What is the best metric match ? BEGIN The local BMW dealer thought 100/90 H 18 on the front and an 120/90 H 18 on the back END BEGIN He also happens too be very good at getting close to to matching mail order prices END BEGIN I am thinking of going with an Metzler ME33 Laser ( possibly Comp K ) on the front and ME88 on the the back , both in MBS variety if possible ( there longer lasting belting system ) END BEGIN I already use the ME33 on both the the Vision a FJ for the front , a like it , a I thought that with the shaft drive behavior and an torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable back end control and an sliding behavior then and ME55 might , as well as giving much better tire milage life END BEGIN Any comments ? BEGIN A friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very good , but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls END BEGIN I do not wish too mount there tires myself this first time , so aside from warning there shop too be careful , any other comments I should make ? BEGIN I hav n't looked at the rim too check out the make yet , if it is marked END BEGIN He just told me late yesterday a I hav n't had an chance too check the rim type END BEGIN On another note END BEGIN I will remove the ugly ( but in good shape END END END anyone wont it ? ) BEGIN Vetter fairing , and an I will run without an windscreen for an while , but eventually I would like and simple rounded cafe ' style quarter fairing for it END BEGIN It could be fork / handlebar mounted END BEGIN Any suggestions ? BEGIN Is the such an thing as a a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe ' style for this bike ? BEGIN How about lower bars / clip-ons for it ? BEGIN I would like too restore there bike into a a good condition runner with an few modern updates , but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well and representation of the cafe ' style END BEGIN ( Yes I know too be picky , that period really predates this bike END END END it is just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look END ) BEGIN - - - Edward Walsh -- -Hewlett-Packard Company - - - edw @ boi END hp END com Disk Memory Division , MS475 ( 208 ) 323-2174 P END BEGIN O END BEGIN Box 15 Boise , Idaho 83707 89FJ1200 ; 82XZ550RJ ( Vision ) ; 75Guzzi850 - T ; D oD # 98 - - - Edward Walsh -- -Hewlett-Packard Company - - - edw @ boi END hp END com Disk Memory Division , MS475 ( 208 ) 396-2174 P END BEGIN O END BEGIN Box 15 Boise , Idaho 83707 89FJ1200 ; 82XZ550RJ ( Vision ) ; 75Guzzi850 - T ; D oD # 98
