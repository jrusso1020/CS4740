BEGIN How To Prevent Kidney Stone Formation I got asked in Sci END BEGIN Med END BEGIN Nutrition about vitamin C and an oxalate production ( toxic , kidney stone formation ? ) BEGIN END BEGIN I decided too post my answer hear as well because of the recent question about kidney stones END BEGIN Not long after I got into Sci END BEGIN Med END BEGIN I got flamed bye and medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation END BEGIN I 'm going too state it again hear END BEGIN But the the best way too prevent kidney stones from forming is too take B6 supplements END BEGIN Read on two find out why ( I have my asbestos suit on now guys ) END BEGIN Vitamin C will form oxalic acid END BEGIN But large doses are needed ( above 6 grams per day ) END BEGIN 1 END BEGIN Review Article `` Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C `` Int END BEGIN Clin END BEGIN Nutr END BEGIN Rev END BEGIN 5 ( 3 ) : 110-129 ( 1985 ) END BEGIN But glycine also forms oxalic acid ( D-amino acid oxidases ) END BEGIN For both glycine a vitamin C , one of the the best ways too drastically reduce this production is not to to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine , but too increase your intake of vitamin B6 END BEGIN 2 END `` BEGIN Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients patients with kidney stones `` Int END BEGIN Urol END BEGIN Nephrol END BEGIN 20 ( 4 ) : 353-59 ( 1988 ) 200 to to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the the urinary excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program END BEGIN 3 END BEGIN The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria `` Clin END BEGIN Sci END BEGIN 38 : 277-86 ( 1970 ) END BEGIN Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day showed a and significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels END BEGIN For gylcine , this effect is due too increased transaminase activity ( B6 is required for transaminase activity ) which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination ( D-amino acid oxidases ) END BEGIN For vitamin C , there affect is quite different END BEGIN There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism END BEGIN The pathway that leads too oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 too 40 % of the the ingested dose going into oxalic acid END BEGIN But this is highly variable a the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 6 grams per day , not too much vitamin C gets catabolized too form oxalic acid END BEGIN At very high doses of vitamin C ( above 10 grams per day ) , more of the extra vitamin C ( more than than 40 % conversion ) can end up as oxalic acid END BEGIN In and very early study on vitamin C and an oxalic production ( Proc END BEGIN Soc END BEGIN Exp END BEGIN Biol END BEGIN Med END BEGIN 85:190- 92 ( 1954 ) , intakes of 2 grams per day up too 9 grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up too 178mg per day END BEGIN Until 8 grams per day was reached , the the average excreted was increased bye only 3 too 12mg per day ( 2 gram dose , 4 gram dose , 8 gram dose and 9gram dose ) END BEGIN 8 grams jumped it too 45mg over the average excretion before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it too to 150 mg over the the average before supplementation END BEGIN B6 is required by by more enzymes then any other vitamin in the the body END BEGIN There are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we do n't know about yet END BEGIN Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires B6 END BEGIN Differences in B6 levels could than explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from an vitamin C challenge ( this is not the preferred route of catabolism ) END BEGIN Increasing your intake of B6 would than result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin C supplements END BEGIN Since the the typical American diet is deficient in B6 , some researchers belief that the main cause of calcium-oxalate kidney stones is B6 deficiency ( especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the the gut ) END BEGIN Diets providing 0 too 130mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate ( Urol Int END BEGIN 35:309 -15,1980 ) END BEGIN If 400mg was present each day , the was and significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion END BEGIN Here are the high oxalate foods : 1 END BEGIN Beans , coca , instant coffee , parsley , rhubarb , spinach a tea END BEGIN Contain at least 25mg / 100grams 2 END BEGIN Beet tops , carrots , celery , chocolate , cumber , grapefruit , kale , peanuts , pepper , sweet potatoe END BEGIN Contain 10 too 25 mg / 100grams END BEGIN If there threshold is 130mg per day , you can see that you really have an lot of latitude in food selection END BEGIN A recent N END Eng END BEGIN J END BEGIN Med END BEGIN article also points out that one good way too prevent kidney stone formation is too increase your intake of calcium which will prevent almost of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all END BEGIN If you also increase your intake of B6 , you should n't have to to worry about kidney stones at all END BEGIN The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for males and 1 END 6 mg per day for females ( directly related too protein intake ) END BEGIN B6 can be toxic ( nerve damage ) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more per day for and an extended peroid ( weeks too months ) END BEGIN The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an an average intake of 1 END 87 mg per day for males and 1 END 16 mg per day for females living in the the U END BEGIN S END BEGIN Coupled with this low intake was and high protein diet ( which greatly increases the B6 requirement ) , as well as the the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that either block B6 absorption , are metabolic antagonists of B6 , or promote B6 excretion in the urine END BEGIN Common ones are : birth control pills , alcohol , isoniazid , penicillamine , a corticosteroids END BEGIN I tell my students to to supplement all their patients that are going too get any of the the drugs that increase there B6 requirement END BEGIN The dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is 10-15 mg per day and an this should work for almost most of the other drugs that increase there B6 requirement ( this would be on top of your dietary intake of B6 ) END BEGIN Any patient that has an history of kidney stone formation should be given B6 supplements END BEGIN One other good way too prevent kidney stone formation is to to make sure your Ca / Mg dietary ratio is 2/1 END BEGIN Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble then is calcium-oxalate END BEGIN 4 END `` BEGIN The magnesium : calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate calculi `` Invest END BEGIN Urol 10:147 ( 1972 )

are actually about three times as many articles published in the medical literature on the roll of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation than the are for B6 END BEGIN I thought that I was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in this news group but good old John A END BEGIN in Mass END BEGIN jumped all over me END BEGIN I guess that he does n't read the medical literature END BEGIN Oh well , since kidney stones can be an real pain and an lot of people suffer from them , I thought I 'd tell you how you can avoid the
