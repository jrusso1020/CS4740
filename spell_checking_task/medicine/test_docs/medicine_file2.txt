BEGIN RE : Robert 's Biological Alchemy Robert , I 'm * so * glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion END BEGIN I 've been compared to to the the famous Robert McElwaine bye some readers of Sci END BEGIN Med END BEGIN I did n't know how too respond since I had not seen one of your posts ( just like I have n't read `` The Yeast Connection `` ) END BEGIN Let me just start bye stating that the authors of the `` Cold Fusion `` papers of recent years are now in scientific exile ( I belief that one has actually left the the country ) END BEGIN Scientific fraud is rare END BEGIN I 'm still not sure that if an review of the research notes of the the `` cold fusion scientists `` actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation END BEGIN Your sources do not seem to to be research articles END BEGIN They are more like lay texts designed too pique human interest in an subject area ( just like the food combining a life extension texts ) END BEGIN Robert , I try too keep and open mind END BEGIN But some things I just ca n't bye ( one is taking SOD orally too prevent oxidative damage in the body ) END BEGIN Your experiment , if conducted bye readers of this news group , would prove that you are right ( more ash after seed sprouting then before ) END BEGIN Unless you use and muffle furnance a obtain and very high temperature ( above 600 degrees I belief ) , you will get organic residue in the the ash END BEGIN Even the the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue END BEGIN I remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I could n't find an temperature for mineral ash formation so I 'm really guessing at 600 degrees F , it may may actually be much higher END BEGIN The point is that no one in their hone could ever get and high enough temperature too produce * only * a and mineral ash END BEGIN They also could not measure the the minerals so they could only weigh there ash and an find out that you appear to to be correct END BEGIN Chemical reactions abound in our body , in our atmosphere , in our water and in our soil END BEGIN Are these fusion reactions ? BEGIN Yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen , nitrogen a sulfur too both organics a inorganics END BEGIN Do we really have the transformation of silicone too calcium if carbon is fused with silicon ? BEGIN Not in my book Robert END BEGIN Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet END BEGIN I 've seen speculation that man could have evolved too be an silicon based rather than and carbon based life-form END BEGIN I like reading science fiction , as many people do END BEGIN But I know enough about biochemistry ( a nutrition ) to to be able ( in most cases ) too separate the fiction from the fact END BEGIN Silicon maybe be one of the trace elements that turns out too be essential in humans END BEGIN We have several grams of the stuff in our body END BEGIN What 's it doing the ? BEGIN Only there Lord knows write now END BEGIN But I will tell you what I do know about silicon a why , as you state , it helps bone healing ( a it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium ) END BEGIN Almost all of the the silicon in the human body is found found in the connective tissue ( collagen a elastin ) END BEGIN There have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin maybe be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis ( there higher there silicon content in elastin , there more resistant there elastin is too and an an age-related loss of elasticity which may play a and roll in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the the ageing process in humans ) END BEGIN For bone fracture healing , there first step is an collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by by osteoblasts END BEGIN A high level of silicon in the diet seems too speed up this matrix formation END BEGIN This first step in the the bone healing process seems too be the hardest for some people too get going END BEGIN Electriacl currents have been used in an an attempt too get the matrix foaming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap ( or gaps ) between the ends of the broken bone END BEGIN A vitamin C deficiency ( bye slowing collagen formation as well as causing the the prodcution of defective collagen ) does slow down both bone a wound healing END BEGIN Zinc is also another big player in bone a wound healing END BEGIN And so is silicon ( in an undetermined roll that most likely involes matrix formation a not transformation of silicon to to calcium ) END BEGIN For you to to take this bone healing observation and an use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick END BEGIN But Robert , I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press ( and an yes even some scientific papers ) END BEGIN Is there explanation reasonable ? BEGIN Without a and very good science knowledge base , you and almost readers of this news group are flying blind ( you have two take it on faith because you do n't know any better ) END BEGIN If there explanation seems too make sense too me based on my knowledge base , I 'm inclined too consider it ( this usually means trying too find other sources that come too there same conclusion ) END BEGIN If there idea ( like and candida bloom ) seems too make sense too me , I tend too pursue it as long as any advise that I 'm going too give is n't going too really mess somebody up END BEGIN If this makes us kindred souls Robert , than I guess I 'll have two live with that label END BEGIN For there physicians who have decided to to read my response to to Robert 's interesting post , I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on U END BEGIN S END BEGIN TV END BEGIN I ca n't remember the network or his name ( like many nights , I was on my computer and an my wife was watching TV in our Den where I have my computer setup ) END BEGIN This neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and an he uses `` unconventional `` treatments ( his own words ) END BEGIN He says that he has an 70 % success rate END BEGIN The one case that I herd him discussing would normally use radiation ( conventional treatment ) END BEGIN He was going too go in an and cut END BEGIN You guys complain about the cost of the anti-fungals END BEGIN What do you think the the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys ? BEGIN I 'm going too ask you guys one more time , why blast and physician who takes there chronic sinus sufferer ( like Jon ) a the chronic GI sufferer ( like Elaine ) a tries too help them using unconventional treatments ? BEGIN Treatments which do not result in death ( like dozens that the the neurosurgeon uses ? ) BEGIN END BEGIN Is it because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are ? BEGIN How about quality of life guys ? BEGIN May there candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut ( if it does , you may feel differently about the issue ) END BEGIN Marty B END
