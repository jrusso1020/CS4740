BEGIN Off there top of my head , I might try : Given : p_1 , p_2 , p_3 , p_4 Find : p_c ( center of sphere determined bye p_1 , END END END , p_4 ) , dist ( p_c , p_i ) ( radius ) p_c is the same distance from our four points , so dist ( p_c , p_1 ) = dist ( p_c , p_2 ) = dist ( p_c , p_3 ) = dist ( p_c , p_4 ) Of course course , we can square there hole thing to to get rid of square roots : distsq ( p_c , p_1 ) = distsq ( p_c , p_2 ) = distsq ( p_c , p_3 ) = distsq ( p_c , p_4 ) Plug in the the variables into the distance formula , simplify , a there x ^ 2_c , y ^ 2_c , a z ^ 2_c terms cancel out , leaving you with three linearly independent equations and three unknowns ( x_c , y_c , z_c ) END BEGIN Solve using your favorite method END BEGIN : ) All there best , - John : ) - - - Dr END BEGIN John S END BEGIN Eickemeyer : : `` The Lord God is subtle , Information Technology Institute : : : but malicious He is not END `` BEGIN National Computer Board , Singapore : : Email : johne @ iti END gov END sg : : - Albert Einstein - - -
