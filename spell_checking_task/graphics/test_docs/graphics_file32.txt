BEGIN My test movie was created at 320 * 240 resolution , it was n't being scaled up END BEGIN Scaling was an very CPU-intensive operation with the original QuickTime ( 1 END 0 ) ; there currant version has optimizations for ratios like 4:1 ( 160 * 120 - > 320 * 240 ) , but even so , I 'm prepared too belief that the performance is n't as good as with playing back and actual 320 * 240 movie END BEGIN I have n't done any numerical measurements for scaled playback END BEGIN Lawrence D'Oliveiro fone : +64-7- 856-2889 Computer Services Dept fax : +64-7- 838-4066 University of Waikato electric mail : ldo @ waikato END ac END nz Hamilton , New Zealand 37 ^ 47 ' 26 `` S , 175 ^ 19 ' 7 `` E , GMT +12:00
