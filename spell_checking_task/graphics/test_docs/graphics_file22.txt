BEGIN [ 14 ] What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images too JPEG ? BEGIN Sections 1-6 are basic info that every JPEG user needs too know ; sections 7-14 are advanced info for the curious END BEGIN This article is posted every 2 weeks END BEGIN You can always find the latest version in the news END answers archive at rtfm END mit END edu ( 18 END 172 END BEGIN 1 END 27 ) END BEGIN By FTP , fetch / pub / usenet / news END answers/jpeg-faq ; or if you do n't have FTP , send e-mail too mail-server @ rtfm END mit END edu with body `` send usenet / news END answers/jpeg-faq `` END BEGIN Many other FAQ articles are also stored in this archive END BEGIN For more instructions on use of the archive , send e-mail too there same address with the words `` help `` and an `` index `` ( no quotes ) on separate lines END BEGIN If you do n't get an reply , there server may be misreading your return address ; add and line such as `` path myname @ mysite `` too specify your correct e-mail address too reply too END BEGIN - - - [ 1 ] What is JPEG ? BEGIN JPEG ( pronounced `` jay-peg `` ) is an standardized image compression mechanism END BEGIN JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group , there original name of the the committee that wrote the standard END BEGIN JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of `` natural `` , real-world scenes END BEGIN It does not work so well on non-realistic images , such as cartoons or line drawings END BEGIN JPEG does not handle black-and-white ( 1 - bit-per-pixel ) images , nor does it handle motion picture compression END BEGIN Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by by other committees , named JBIG a MPEG respectively END BEGIN JPEG is `` lossy `` , meaning that the the image you get out of decompression is n't quiet identical too what you originally put in END BEGIN The algorithm achieves much of its compression by by exploiting known limitations of the human eye , notably there fact that small color details are n't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark END BEGIN Thus , JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at bye humans END BEGIN If you plan too machine-analyze your images , there small errors introduced bye JPEG maybe be an problem for you , even if they are invisible too the the eye END BEGIN A useful property of JPEG is that the the degree of lossiness can be varied bye adjusting compression parameters END BEGIN This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality END BEGIN You can make * extremely * small files if you do n't mind poor quality ; this is useful for indexing image archives , making thumbnail views or icons , etc END BEGIN etc END BEGIN Conversely , if you are n't happy with the output quality at the the default compression setting , you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied , and an except lesser compression END BEGIN [ 2 ] Why use JPEG ? BEGIN There are two good reasons : too make your image files smaller , a too store 24 - bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8 - bit-per-pixel data END BEGIN Making image files smaller is an big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images END BEGIN Being able too compress and 2 Mbyte full-color file down too 100 Kbytes or so makes and big difference in disk space and transmission time ! BEGIN ( If you are comparing GIF a JPEG , the the size ratio is more like four too one END BEGIN More details below END ) BEGIN If your viewing software does n't support JPEG directly , you 'll have too convert JPEG too some other format for viewing or manipulating images END BEGIN Even with an JPEG-capable viewer , it takes longer too decode and an view an JPEG image than than too view an image of an simpler format ( GIF , for instance ) END BEGIN Thus , using JPEG is essentially and time / space tradeoff : you give up some time in order too store or transmit and image more cheaply END BEGIN It 's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved , there time savings from transferring and shorter file can be much greater than than the extra time too decompress the file END BEGIN I 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself END BEGIN The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a and standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information : 24 bits / pixel ( 16 million colors ) instead of 8 or less ( 256 or fewer colors ) END BEGIN If you have only 8 - bit display hardware then this may may not seem seem like much of an advantage to to you END BEGIN Within and couple of years , though , 8 - bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today END BEGIN Furthermore , for reasons detailed in section 7 , JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware END BEGIN Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as an Usenet posting standard END BEGIN [ 3 ] When should I use JPEG , a when should I stick with GIF ? BEGIN JPEG is * not * going too displace GIF entirely ; for some types of images , GIF is superior in image quality , file size , or both END BEGIN One of the first things too learn about JPEG is which kinds of images too apply it to to END BEGIN As and rule of thumb , JPEG is superior to to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of `` realistic `` scenes ; that means scanned photographs and similar material END BEGIN JPEG is superior even if you do n't have 24 - bit display hardware , a it is an LOT superior if you do END BEGIN ( See section 7 for details END ) BEGIN GIF does significantly better on images with only and few distinct colors , such as cartoons and an line drawings END BEGIN In particular , large areas of pixels that are all * exactly * there same color are compressed very efficiently indeed bye GIF END BEGIN JPEG ca n't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects END BEGIN This sort of image is best kept in GIF form END BEGIN ( In particular , single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files , but they should be avoided in JPEG files END ) BEGIN JPEG also has an hard time with very sharp edges : and row of pure-black pixels adjacent to to an row of pure-white pixels , for example END BEGIN Sharp edges tend to to come out blurred unless you use and very high quality setting END BEGIN Again , this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs , but it shows up fairly often in GIF files : borders , overlaid text , etc END BEGIN The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that 's only and few pixels high END BEGIN If you have an GIF with an lot of small-size overlaid text , do n't JPEG it END BEGIN Computer-drawn images ( ray-traced scenes , for instance ) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity END BEGIN The more complex and subtly rendered the image , there more likely that JPEG will do well on it END BEGIN The same goes for semi-realistic artwork ( fantasy drawings and an such ) END BEGIN Plain black-and-white ( too level ) images should never be converted too JPEG END BEGIN You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images END BEGIN It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to to 256 levels , while JPEG is not END BEGIN If you have an existing library of GIF images , you may wonder whether whether you should convert them too JPEG END BEGIN You will lose and little image quality if you do END BEGIN ( Section 7 , which argues that JPEG image quality is superior too GIF , only applies if both formats start from and full-color original END BEGIN If you start from and GIF , you 've already irretrievably lost a and great deal of information ; JPEG can only make things worse END ) BEGIN However , the the disk space savings may justify converting anyway END BEGIN This is an decision you 'll have too make for yourself END BEGIN If you do convert an GIF library too JPEG , see section 14 for hints END BEGIN Be prepared too leave some images in GIF format , since some GIFs will not convert well END BEGIN [ 4 ] How well does JPEG compress images ? BEGIN Pretty darn well END BEGIN Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy , and 727x525 full-color image of an ship in an harbor END BEGIN The first three files are for comparison purposes ; there rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B END BEGIN File Size in bytes Comments ship END ppm 1145040 Original file in PPM format ( no compression ; 24 bits or 3 bytes per pixel , plus and few bytes overhead ) ship END ppm END BEGIN Z 963829 PPM file passed through Unix compress compress does n't accomplish and lot , you 'll note END BEGIN Other text-oriented compressors give similar results END BEGIN ship END gif 240438 Converted too GIF with ppmquant - fs 256 | ppmtogif Most of the savings is the result of losing color info : GIF saves 8 bits / pixel , not 24 END BEGIN ( See sec END BEGIN 7 END ) BEGIN ship END BEGIN jpg 95 155622 cjpeg - Q 95 ( highest useful quality setting ) This is indistinguishable from the 24 - bit original , at least two my nonprofessional eyeballs END BEGIN ship END BEGIN jpg 75 58009 cjpeg - Q 75 ( default setting ) You have too look mighty darn close to to distinguish this from the original , even with both on-screen at once END BEGIN ship END BEGIN jpg 50 38406 cjpeg - Q 50 This has slight defects ; if you know what too look for , you could tell it 's been JPEGed without seeing the original END BEGIN Still as good image quality as many recent postings in Usenet pictures groups END BEGIN ship END BEGIN jpg 25 25192 cjpeg - Q 25 JPEG 's characteristic `` blockiness `` becomes apparent at this setting ( djpeg - blocksmooth helps some ) END BEGIN Still , I 've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this END BEGIN ship END BEGIN jpg 5o 6587 cjpeg - Q 5 - optimize ( - optimize cuts table overhead ) Blocky , but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes END BEGIN Note that this file is TINY : there compression ratio from the the original is 173:1 ! BEGIN In this case JPEG can make and file that 's and factor of four or five smaller than an GIF of comparable quality ( there - Q 75 file is every bit as good as the the GIF , better if you have an full-color display ) END BEGIN This seems too be an typical ratio for real-world scenes END BEGIN [ 5 ] What are good `` quality `` settings for JPEG ? BEGIN Most JPEG compressors let you pick an file size vs END BEGIN image quality tradeoff bye selecting and quality setting END BEGIN There seems too be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings END `` BEGIN Quality 95 `` does NOT mean `` keep 95 % of the information `` , as some have claimed END BEGIN The quality scale is purely arbitrary ; it 's not a and percentage of anything END BEGIN The name of the game in using JPEG is too pick the lowest quality setting ( smallest file size ) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original END BEGIN This setting will vary from one image too another and from one observer too another , but here are some rules of thumb END BEGIN The default quality setting ( - Q 75 ) is very often the best choice END BEGIN This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting too see defects in a and typical image END BEGIN Try - Q 75 first ; if you see defects , than go up END BEGIN Except for experimental purposes , never go above - Q 95 ; saying - Q 100 will produce and file too or three times as large as - Q 95 , but of hardly any better quality END BEGIN If there image was less than perfect quality too begin with , you might be able too go down too - Q 50 without objectionable degradation END BEGIN On there other hand , you might need to to go too and HIGHER quality setting too avoid further degradation END BEGIN The second case seems to to apply much of the time when converting GIFs too JPEG END BEGIN The default - Q 75 is about right for compressing 24 - bit images , but - Q 85 too 95 is usually better for converting GIFs ( see section 14 for more info ) END BEGIN If you want and very small file ( say for preview or indexing purposes ) a are prepared too tolerate large defects , and - Q setting in the the range of 5 too 10 is about right END BEGIN - Q 2 or so may be amusing as `` op art `` END BEGIN ( Note : there quality settings discussed in this article apply too there free JPEG software described in section 6B , a too many programs based on it END BEGIN Other JPEG implementations , such as Image Alchemy , may may use and completely different quality scale END BEGIN Some programs do n't even provide an numeric scale , just `` high `` / `` medium `` / `` low `` - style choices END ) BEGIN [ 6 ] Where can I get JPEG software ? BEGIN Most of the programs described in this section are available by by FTP END BEGIN If you do n't know how too use FTP , see the FAQ article `` How to to find sources `` END BEGIN ( If you do n't have direct access too FTP , read about ftpmail servers in the the same article END ) BEGIN That article appears regularly in news END answers , or you can get it bye sending e-mail too mail-server @ rtfm END mit END edu with `` send usenet / news END answers/finding-sources `` in the body END BEGIN The `` Anonymous FTP List FAQ `` maybe also be helpful - - - it 's usenet / news END answers/ftp-list/faq in the news END answers archive END BEGIN NOTE : this list changes constantly END BEGIN If you have an copy more than than an couple months old , get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news END answers archive END BEGIN [ 6A ] If you are looking for `` canned `` software , viewers , etc : The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system END BEGIN If you do n't see what you want for your machine , check out there portable JPEG software described at the end of the list END BEGIN Note that this list concentrates on free and an shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet ; but some commercial programs are listed too END BEGIN X Windows : John Bradley 's free XV ( version 2 END 00 a up ) is an excellent viewer for JPEG , GIF , a other image formats END BEGIN It 's available for FTP from export END lcs END mit END edu or ftp END cis END upenn END edu END BEGIN The file is called ' xv - ? BEGIN ? BEGIN ? BEGIN END BEGIN tar END BEGIN Z ' ( where ? BEGIN ? BEGIN ? BEGIN is the version number , currently 2 END 21 ) ; it is located in the the ' contrib ' directory on export or the ' pub / xv ' directory at upenn END BEGIN XV reduces all images too 8 bits internally , which means it 's not and real good choice if you have an 24 - bit display ( you 'll still get only 8 - bit color ) END BEGIN Also , you should n't use XV too convert full-color images too JPEG , because they 'll get color-quantized first END BEGIN But XV is an fine tool for converting GIF and an other 8 - bit images to to JPEG END BEGIN CAUTION : the is an glitch in versions 2 END 21 a earlier : be sure to to check the `` save at normal size `` checkbox when saving and JPEG file , or the file will be blurry END BEGIN Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy 's free ImageMagick package , also available from export END lcs END mit END edu , file contrib / ImageMagick END tar END BEGIN Z END BEGIN This package handles many image processing and an conversion tasks END BEGIN The ImageMagick viewer handles 24 - bit displays correctly ; for colormapped displays , it does better ( though slower ) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software END BEGIN Both of the above are large , complex packages END BEGIN If you just want want and simple image viewer , try xloadimage or xli END BEGIN xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release , 3 END 03 END BEGIN xloadimage is free and available from export END lcs END mit END edu , file contrib / xloadimage END 3 END 03 END tar END BEGIN Z END BEGIN xli is a and variant version of xloadimage , said bye its fans too be somewhat faster and more robust than the original END BEGIN ( The currant xli is indeed faster and more robust than the the current xloadimage , at least with respect too JPEG files , because it has the the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3 END 03 is using an hacked-over v1 END BEGIN The next xloadimage release will fix this END ) BEGIN xli is also free and available from export END lcs END mit END edu , file contrib / xli END 1 END 14 END tar END BEGIN Z END BEGIN Both programs are said too do the right thing with 24 - bit displays END BEGIN MS-DOS : This covers plain DOS ; for Windows or OS / 2 programs , see the next headings END BEGIN One good choice is Eric Praetzel 's free DVPEG , which views JPEG a GIF files END BEGIN The currant version , 2 END 4 a and , is available bye FTP from sunee END uwaterloo END ca ( 129 END 97 END BEGIN 50 END 50 ) , file pub / jpeg / viewers / dvpeg24a END zip END BEGIN This is a and good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines END BEGIN The user interface is not flashy , but it 's functional END BEGIN Another freeware JPEG / GIF / TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei 's Hiview END BEGIN The currant version , 1 END 2 , is available from Simtel 20 a mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / hv12 END zip END BEGIN Hiview requires an 386 or better CPU a and VCPI-compatible memory manager ( QEMM 386 a 386MAX work ; Windows a OS / 2 do not ) END BEGIN Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen END BEGIN For larger images , it scales the the image down too fit on the screen ( rather than using panning / scrolling as most viewers do ) END BEGIN You maybe or maybe not prefer this approach , but the 's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably END BEGIN Note : installation is an bit tricky ; read the the directions carefully ! BEGIN A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ( $ 30 ) END BEGIN This is easier too install than either of the two freeware alternatives END BEGIN Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking , although personally I find it harder too use - - - more keystrokes , inconsistent behavior END BEGIN It is faster than DVPEG but and little slower than Hiview , at least on my hardware END BEGIN ( For images larger than screen size , DVPEG a ColorView seam too be about the same speed , and an both are faster than Hiview END ) BEGIN The current current version is 2 END 1 , available from Simtel 20 a mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / dcview21 END zip END BEGIN Requires and VESA graphics driver ; if you do n't have one , look in vesadrv2 END zip or vesa-tsr END zip from the the same directory END BEGIN ( Many recent PCs have an built-in VESA driver , so do n't try to to load a and VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing END ) BEGIN A second shareware alternative is Fullview , which has been kicking around the net for an while , but I do n't know any stable archive location for it END BEGIN The currant ( rather old ) version is inferior to to the above viewers anyway END BEGIN The author tells me that a and knew version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted too the the Simtel 20 archives at that time END BEGIN The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow ( CSHOW ) supports JPEG in its latest revision , 8 END 60 and END BEGIN However , CSHOW 's JPEG implementation is n't very good : it 's slow ( about half the the speed of the above viewers ) and an image quality is poor except on hi-color displays END BEGIN Too badly END END END it 'd have been nice too see and good JPEG capability in CSHOW END BEGIN Shareware , $ 25 END BEGIN Available from Simtel 20 and an mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / gif / cshw860a END zip END BEGIN Due too there remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware , any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine END BEGIN If you ca n't get * any * of them too work , you 'll need too use one of the following conversion programs to to convert JPEG too GIF , then then view with your favorite GIF viewer END BEGIN ( If you have hi-color hardware , do n't use GIF as the the intermediate format ; try too find and TARGA-capable viewer instead END BEGIN VPIC 5 END 0 is reputed too do the the right thing with hi-color displays END ) BEGIN The Independent JPEG Group 's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel 20 and an mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / jpeg4 END zip ( or jpeg4386 END zip if you have an 386 and an extended memory ) END BEGIN These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B ; they will convert JPEG too a from GIF , Targa , a PPM formats END BEGIN Handmade Software offers free JPEG < = > GIF conversion tools , GIF 2JPG / JPG 2GIF END BEGIN These are slow and are limited too conversion too a from GIF format ; in particular , you ca n't get 24 - bit color output from and JPEG END BEGIN The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI 's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format END BEGIN Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes , this is an useful capability END BEGIN Version 2 END 0 of these tools is free ( prior versions were shareware ) END BEGIN Get it from Simtel 20 a mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / gif2jpg2 END zip END BEGIN NOTE : do not use HSI format for files too be posted on Internet , since it is not readable on non-PC platforms END BEGIN Handmade Software also has an shareware image conversion and manipulation package , Image Alchemy END BEGIN This will translate JPEG files ( both JFIF a HSI formats ) too a from many other image formats END BEGIN It can also display images END BEGIN A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1 END 6 END BEGIN 1 is available from Simtel 20 and an mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / alch161 END zip END BEGIN NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL 20 : The Internet 's key archive site site for PC-related programs is Simtel 20 , full name wsmr-simtel20 END army END mil ( 192 END 88 END BEGIN 110 END 20 ) END BEGIN Simtel 20 runs and non-Unix system with weird directory names ;
